Freepress CMS
---
The *permanent, unstoppable* free press.

Freepress CMS is a proof-of-concept decentralized CMS for personal blogging, powered by *Ethereum Blockchain* and *Swarm*.

> :warning: This is pre-production software with very minimal testing, and is certainly not audited. Use at your own risk.

# Features
- Write your blog posts in Markdown, then publish them to your personal blog smart contract!
- Posts are uploaded to the Swarm network (`web3.bzz`)
- Post registry is stored in a smart contract on Ethereum Blockchain
- Readers can open a webpage to read your blog, if they have the contract address
  - All they need is *Metamask* or *Mist*. Reading is completely free!
- Blog owner can use the web client to upload, edit, and remove blog posts
  - It doesn't actually delete or edit the post file. It only removes the record from the contract
- Readers can write comments on any blog post
- Readers can support the blogger by sending some ether along with a comment

# Roadmap
- Better UI
- Theme support
- Messaging with Whisper (`web3.shh`)
- WYSIWYG editor
